## How to Play '9s'

In "9s", three players compete over a round of golf. After each hole, 9 points are distributed among the players as follows:

- The player with the lowest score on the hole gets 5 points.
- The player with the second-lowest score gets 3 points.
- The player with the highest score gets 1 point.
- If two players tie for the lowest score, they get 4 points each, and the third player gets 1 point.
- If two players tie for the highest score, they get 2 points each, and the third player gets 5 points.
- If all three players tie, they each get 3 points.

The game continues throughout the round, and the player with the most points at the end is declared the winner.
